For as long as I’ve worked in tech, there’s been a constant tension between being a specialist (someone who dives deep into a single technology or domain) and being a generalist, the kind of person who floats between disciplines, connecting dots and picking up new tools on the fly. Historically, the industry has often favored specialists. Need to wrangle a gnarly GraphQL schema or optimize a React app to within an inch of its life? You call in the expert.

This is naturally more true in bigger companies than in smaller companies, but still this has been generally the trend in the last decades.

But lately, I’ve noticed a shift. I notice this shift also within myself. The rise of AI, especially the new breed of coding assistants, design generators, and knowledge engines has started to tilt the playing field. We’re entering what I’d call **the age of the generalist**.

#### Why now?

AI doesn’t replace expertise, but it lowers the barrier to entry for so many tasks. If you’re a backend developer who’s always been curious about front-end design, suddenly you have tools that can help you generate layouts, suggest color palettes, or even write the CSS for you. If you’re a product manager dabbling in code, AI can help you scaffold out a prototype without having to spend weeks learning a new framework from scratch.

This isn’t just about speed, it’s about confidence. The fear of “not knowing enough” is softened when you have an always-on tutor ready to explain, suggest, and even fix your mistakes. The generalist, who thrives on curiosity and breadth, suddenly finds themselves with a superpower.

#### Specialists are still needed

That’s not to say depth doesn’t matter. There are problems, complex systems, edge cases, architectural decisions where deep expertise is irreplaceable. But the day-to-day work of building products, shipping features, and exploring new ideas is increasingly accessible to those willing to branch out.

#### A new kind of team

I’ve seen this firsthand on projects where the lines blur between roles. Designers write code, developers sketch wireframes, and everyone learns from each other. AI accelerates this cross-pollination. Teams become more fluid, less siloed. The “T-shaped” skillset, broad with one area of depth, becomes easier to cultivate.

#### Embracing the change

For those who’ve always felt like outsiders for not specializing, this is your moment. The industry is opening up. The tools are on your side. The best teams will be those that embrace learning, experimentation, and a bit of healthy generalism.

We’re not losing the need for experts, but we’re gaining a new respect for the curious, the adaptable, and the endlessly interested. In the age of AI, the generalists aren't just welcome, they’re essential
